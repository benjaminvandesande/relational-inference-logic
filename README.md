# Relational Logic System (Prolog)

This system models familial relationships using Prolog. It defines a base set of facts (e.g. parent, gender, birth year) and derives complex relationships (e.g. sibling, uncle, cousin) through inference rules. 

The goal is to demonstrate logic programming for relational data structures using clear, deterministic rule definitions and testable queries.
