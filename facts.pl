    facts.pl
    -------------------------
    This file defines the core relational data for the Prolog-based
    family relationship inference engine. It includes:

    - Gender: male/1, female/1
    - Birth years: born/2
    - Marriages: married/2
    - Parent-child links: parent/2

    This data is separated from logic and test rules for clarity and modularity.
    Only base facts are declared here â€” no derived logic.
