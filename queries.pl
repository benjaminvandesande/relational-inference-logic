/* 
    Inference Test Layer â€” queries.pl
    ----------------------------------
    This file defines conversational smoke tests for the core relational
    inference rules for the Prolog-based family relationship inference engine.

    -- Purpose -- 
    - Validate each logical rule immediately after definition
    - Confirm rule behavior matches expected relationships

    Notes:
    - Organize queries by rule section for clarity and traceability.
    - Run after facts.pl and rules.pl are both loaded in.
